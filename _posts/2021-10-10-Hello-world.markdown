Hi Welcome to my development blog ! :computer:

I will be sharing my ideas, thoughts and document my work here.
Each development project has it's own story, exposure to new challenges and takeaways. these things fade away with time so it's agood idea to document things, Thanx to mama who gave this idea.
And it wont be just about tech and code, some meme and personal stuffs X)

So, Bookmark or subscribe to stay updated <3

This year I have been experinting *a lot* with blogging platforms, starting from Blogger, Wordpress to Ghost, but all have their own pros and cons, Blogger is free, quite user friendly but SEO and it's outdated :( and for a tech savy like me, blogger... NAAH.

then comes wordpress, great themes,SEO support but hosting costs :/ yeah could have hosted on heroku but load times are quite slow.
then comes Ghost, it's one of the best blogging platform, loved the features and casper theme hosted it on Google cloud too, but still didnt worked out.

So, here it is!  A Jekyll based Casper theme blog served from Github pages. Markdown made right from terminal.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
