The task was to make API for 
 - *sign_up* to add users ( with password validation)
 - *sign_in* check existing user
 - *clean*  delete all users

I used flask and python, 

create three routes with POST method
 - /api/sign_up
 - /api/sign_in
 - /api/clean

for storing users, I used a list of dictionaries. 
[ {},
  {}
]

request.json['name'] , request.json['email'] , request.json['password'] gives the required variable from JSON request.

<strong> now we can use them to vaildate password , check existing user and add the new user to list. </strong>
 - regex expression to validate password
 - iterated over list to check for same email ( if different append to the list)
 - if email & password exists sign in success.



Working With POSTMAN ,
